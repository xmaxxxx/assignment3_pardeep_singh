        <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
        <p>HTML and CSS work together to create beautiful web pages. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the styling and layout. Together, they form the foundation of modern web development.</p>

                <h2>HTML & CSS Integration</h2>
                <p>There are three ways to integrate CSS with HTML: inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets. External stylesheets are the most recommended method as they promote better code organization and maintainability.</p>
                <p>CSS selectors target HTML elements to apply styles. You can select elements by their tag names, classes, IDs, and other attributes. Understanding the relationship between HTML elements and CSS selectors is crucial for effective web development.</p>
                <p>The CSS Box Model is fundamental to layout design. Every HTML element is treated as a box with properties like margin, border, padding, and content. Understanding how these properties interact is essential for precise layout control.</p>

                    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                    <p>Using HTML semantic elements along with CSS media queries allows creation of responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes. This combination ensures your content looks great on all devices.</p>

                    <h2>Layout Systems</h2>
                    <p>Modern CSS provides powerful layout systems like Flexbox and Grid that work with HTML structure to create complex layouts. These systems have revolutionized how we approach web design.</p>
